# Getting Started

Initialize the cmake project using
'''
cmake .
'''
Afterwards you can simple compile the project using make. The binaries are located in /bin.

# Usage

Calculating surface vector and curvature at certain point:
'''
./bin/grid x-size y-size spacing [Sphere | Rectangle] [parameters] x y
'''
Note: boundary conditions must be also specified after invoking the program.

Advance surface:
'''
./bin/advancer x-size y-size spacing [Sphere | Rectangle] [parameters]
'''
